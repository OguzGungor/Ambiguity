### Description

 IQ Puzzler Pro game is a game which has two options such as 2D and 3D. There are different shapes conducted by spheres, and user will be able to build a figure by using those shapes. Game includes a lot of challenges with different difficulties to build such as there is diverse levels to choose, and game will get harder in every level. In lower levels there will be more than 1 shape already placed in its place, however in the higher levels amount of placed shapes will be decreased and that will make it harder to complete the figure. In addition to these, there will be time limit for each level. In the beginning levels time required will be less in order to that level will not be too hard. However when user reaches the harder levels, there will be more time given to the user to complete it. There will also be a high score kept, and the user will be able to go back and play already finished level to be able to increase his/her score. Score will be calculated according to the time user spent on the level and how succesful he/she was while finishing the level. There will be help button for the user to get help from when he/she needs such. However, when user uses the help button, one shape will be placed accordingly to its place and this will lead to lose points in calculating the points. If user will not be able to collect the certain amount of points or will not be able to finish the level on time, game will be over. The user also can get few more seconds to be able to finish the level, but just like getting help, some points will be decreased. There will be 12 shapes and each of them will be in different colors. In each level colors will change randomly, but there won't be two shapes with the same color. In 2D version of the game, the shape which is required to be build will be rectangular. In 3D version of the game, the shape which is required to be build will be pyramid. At the end of the level, when level is successfully done, the figure which is complete will be the same color although it was contained by 12 different colors.
